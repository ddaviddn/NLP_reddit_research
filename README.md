README
-------------------------------------
In this semester project, I will be using a Reddit database to analyze the language used

in politically-focused subreddits. Specifically striving to compare and contrast the language

used in politically right/left reddit community pages. Applying different methods of Natural

Language Processing techniques that I learned starting from the beginning of the research,

these techniques will assist in getting a better understanding of the words used and help

us find any distinctions in the language for these two opposing political spectrums. From

learning how to extract and query from the database, to learning about one of the most

important steps in the NLP workflowâ€“the text processing phase, and later on learning how to

turn comments into numerically-represented vectors. Each of these newly acquired methods

led to the opportunity to analyze and extract valuable information through our open-source

social network database.
